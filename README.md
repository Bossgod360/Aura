# Aura: Terraforming the Future 🌍🚀
**Aura** is an innovative hackathon project aimed at exploring the concept of terraforming as a solution to Earth's overpopulation and dwindling resources. By transforming extraterrestrial environments into habitable ecosystems..

## 🌐 Project Overview
Terraforming refers to modifying a planet's environment to make it suitable for life. In our vision, this process includes several stages, from creating an operational base to stabilizing planetary ecosystems and ultimately establishing self-sustaining human civilizations.

## Key Features
### Fixing Earth
We start by addressing Earth’s ecological challenges, establishing sustainable solutions to support life here as we prepare to venture outward.

### Disrupting Space
Our "Great Expansion" initiative focuses on setting up habitable outposts in space, driven by cutting-edge technology to sustain human life far beyond our home planet.

The Future of the Future
Aura’s long-term goal is to propel humanity toward becoming a Type II civilization, extending human presence across planets and making interstellar existence a reality.

## 💡 FAQ
What problem are we solving?
Aura aims to tackle Earth’s resource depletion and overpopulation by exploring new worlds for habitation. Terraforming provides a scalable solution to preserve and extend human civilization.

### What is terraforming?
In essence, terraforming is a process to reform a planet’s ecology and topography to make it livable for humans. Our approach unfolds over several stages, gradually transforming inhospitable planets into homes.

### Why is this important?
By 2050, Earth could face unprecedented environmental and societal strain. Aura offers a proactive solution, focusing on sustainability and the potential of space expansion.
### Who are the founders?
Aura was co-founded by Aryan Khimani and Olivka Rozenberg, united by a shared mission to pioneer humanity’s next great leap.
